Hi! We at Ecwid by Lightspeed are highly interested in hiring developers in Tbilisi and Yerevan.

At Ecwid by Lightspeed Customization Service, we're the go-to team for Ecwid merchants who want something special for their online stores. Think of us as the behind-the-scenes experts who add those special touches to make each store unique. Our tools? We use the latest in technology like Vue3, NodeJS, TypeScript, and Postgres to build custom features that set Ecwid stores apart. Whether it's tweaking the storefront or adding new functionalities, we rely on Ecwid's JS API and REST API to tailor solutions that fit each merchant's needs.

Our job is all about variety and creativity. One day we might be working on a custom payment feature, the next on syncing data across different systems, or setting up a new shipping option. We're part technicians, part inventors, always figuring out how to turn complex needs into simple, effective solutions. Whether we're integrating new payment systems or connecting with shipping providers, our goal is to help Ecwid merchants enhance their stores, making each one as distinct and effective as the businesses they represent.

Go ahead to the Developer's test task, do it as you see fit and send the result to join-ecom@lightspeedhq.com.
